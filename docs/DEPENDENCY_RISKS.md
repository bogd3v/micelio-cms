# Dependency risks

Dependabot alerts that stay open because the fix needs a major version that a parent package pins. Each entry says why the risk is accepted and what would close it. Review this list on every Strapi upgrade. Patches within the same major go in through `overrides` in `package.json` instead (see `SECURITY.md`).

Last reviewed: 2026-10-02, Strapi 5.56.0.

## Fixed through overrides

The parent pins an older patch of the same major, so `overrides` lifts it:

| Package               | Pinned by                                        | Override  | Alerts closed      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| `nodemailer`          | `@strapi/provider-email-nodemailer` (9.0.1)      | `^9.1.1`  | 4 of 7 (see below) |
| `postcss`             | `styled-components` (8.4.31, 8.4.49)             | `^8.5.28` | 4                  |
| `markdown-it`         | `@strapi/content-manager` (14.3.0)               | `^14.3.2` | 1                  |
| `dompurify`           | `@strapi/content-manager` (3.4.13)               | `^3.4.16` | 1                  |
| `@opentelemetry/core` | `@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics` (2.7.1, via Fedify) | `^2.8.0`  | 1                  |
| `axios`               | `@strapi/*` (1.19.0)                             | `^1.20.0` | npm audit          |

Drop an override once the parent ships the patched version, so it doesn't hold back later updates.

`nodemailer` 9.1.1 is a net gain, not a clean fix: it closes 4 of the 7 advisories on 9.0.1, but 2 newer ones only affect `>=9.1.0` (GHSA-g57g-f23g-4646, GHSA-prgh-xp8r-p3m5). That leaves 5 advisories instead of 7, with 2 high in both versions.

## Pinned direct dependencies

- `knex` 3.0.1 is a direct dependency only so the rate limiting store (`src/utils/rate-limit/stores.ts`) can import it. It must stay on the exact version `@strapi/database` pins: bump it together with Strapi, never alone (close Dependabot PRs that bump only `knex`).
- `rate-limiter-flexible` 11.2.1 (ISC, no runtime dependencies) is pinned exactly; see `docs/RATE_LIMITING.md`.

To dismiss these alerts on GitHub, use the reason `tolerable_risk` for `nodemailer`, `react-router` and `stream-json`, and `vulnerable_code_not_actually_used` for the rest.
