# Fediverse Federation (ActivityPub) Plan & Architecture

This document is the source of truth for connecting the BogDev blog backend to the fediverse, so users on Mastodon (and any other ActivityPub network) can follow the blog, receive published articles in their timeline, and reply, like, and boost — with replies landing as moderated comments in the existing `strapi-plugin-comments` collection.

> **Status: Phases 0–4 complete and verified live on staging. Phase 5 is done and federation is live in production (`@devbog@api.bogdev.com.co`); only cross-server verification against a non-Mastodon implementation is still open.** `develop` deploys to staging, `main` to production. Implementation is tracked in the [`fediverse-federation` milestone](https://github.com/bogd3v/micelio-cms/milestone/1) (one issue per phase, 0–5). Update the phase checklist in this document as work progresses so future agents always see the current state.

## Goal & Decisions

| Decision         | Choice                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture     | **Fedify embedded in Strapi** as a local plugin — no sidecar service, single deploy unit                                            |
| Protocol library | [`@fedify/fedify`](https://fedify.dev) + `@fedify/koa` Koa middleware (same stack Ghost uses for its ActivityPub)                   |
| Actor domain     | `api.bogdev.com.co` → handle `@bogdev@api.bogdev.com.co` (formerly `@devbog`) (served directly by Strapi; no reverse-proxy changes) |
| Actor identity   | Single blog actor (not per-author)                                                                                                  |
| Replies storage  | Existing `strapi-plugin-comments` collection, entering as `PENDING` for the existing approval workflow                              |
| MVP scope        | Follow + article federation + replies-as-comments **plus likes & boosts**                                                           |
| i18n             | MVP federates the default locale only                                                                                               |

Rejected alternatives (for context):

- **Sidecar microservice** (Ghost's exact `TryGhost/ActivityPub` architecture) — cleaner isolation but an extra Dokploy service, proxy config, and database.
- **Bridgy Fed + webmentions** — zero protocol code but a third-party hosted bridge, frontend microformats2 changes, and less control.
- **Cross-posting to an existing Mastodon account** — syndication, not federation; replies would not flow back as site comments.

   Article objects carry url → https://bogdev.com.co/blog/{slug}
   (humans click through to the frontend; the fediverse dereferences
    the JSON-LD object on api.bogdev.com.co)
```

Fedify handles the protocol hard parts: HTTP signatures (including Mastodon's draft-cavage vs RFC 9421 "double-knock" quirks), WebFinger server, NodeInfo, JSON-LD Activity Vocabulary, and inbox signature verification **before** any listener code runs.

**Path collisions:** Strapi already serves `/api/*`, `/admin`, `/upload/*`, `/_health`, `/mcp`, and static `/public`. Neither `/.well-known/*` (unused) nor `/fediverse/*` (new prefix) collide with anything.

## Components

### Local plugin `src/plugins/fediverse/`

| Part                      | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `register()`              | Create the `Federation` instance and mount `@fedify/koa` middleware via `strapi.server.use()` (must be `register()`, not `bootstrap()` — see Phase 0 findings)                                                                                                        |
| `bootstrap()`             | Subscribe to `entry.publish` / `entry.unpublish` / `entry.delete` on `strapi.eventHub` (Strapi 5 does **not** emit publish lifecycles via `strapi.db.lifecycles` — see Phase 0 findings); `services/publisher.ts` turns them into `Create`/`Update`/`Delete(Article)` |
| Actor dispatcher          | Serves `/fediverse/user/devbog` — name/bio/avatar/header from the `global` single type, `Blog`/`Código` profile fields, `url` pointing at the frontend                                                                                                                |
| Key pairs dispatcher      | Reads keypairs from plugin store (`strapi.store({ type: 'plugin', name: 'fediverse' })`)                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Article object dispatcher | Serves `/fediverse/articles/:documentId` as an `Article` (title, self-contained HTML body, frontend `url`, cover image) — published default-locale articles only                                                                                                      |
| Outbox dispatcher         | Serves `/fediverse/user/devbog/outbox` — paginated, publicly-addressed `Create(Article)` activities, so a remote server can show/backfill recent posts before anyone there has followed the blog                                                                      |
| Followers dispatcher      | Backed by the `fediverse-follower` content type                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| NodeInfo dispatcher       | Serves `/nodeinfo/2.1` with honest software/usage stats (published article count)                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Inbox listeners           | `Follow`, `Undo(Follow)`, `Block`, `Create(Note)`, `Update(Note)`, `Delete(Note)`, `Like`, `Announce` + `Undo`                                                                                                                                                        |
| Services                  | `articles` + `publisher` (Phase 2), `replies` (Phase 3), `interactions` (Phase 4), `followers`/`keys`/`actor-profile` (Phase 1)                                                                                                                                       |

### Plugin content types

| Content type                    | Fields                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin::fediverse.follower`    | `actorId` (string, AP actor URI), `handle` (`@user@host`), `name`, `inbox`, `avatar`, `blocked` (boolean)                                                                         |
| `plugin::fediverse.interaction` | `type` (enum `like`/`boost`), `actorId`, `handle`, `articleDocumentId` (string, not a relation — see Phase 4 findings), `interactionKey` (`type\|actor\|article`, used to dedupe) |

### Comment schema extension

`src/extensions/comments/strapi-server.ts` — extends `strapi-plugin-comments` with the fields below. It is a `strapi-server` extension (not an extension `schema.json`) on purpose: Strapi merges schema files shallowly (`{ ...original, ...extension }`), so a `schema.json` declaring `attributes` would replace every attribute of the plugin and break it on the next upgrade.

| Field                  | Purpose                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fediverseUri`         | Remote Note object id (unique — checked by the Document Service, not a DB index) — dedupe of ingested replies + thread resolution |
| `fediverseActorHandle` | `@user@host`, or `null` when it could not be resolved of the remote author (display/source badge on frontend)                     |

### Custom public routes

All `auth: false`, aggregates only (never who interacted), and absent when `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED=false`.

- `GET /api/fediverse/articles/:documentId/stats` → `{ likes: number, boosts: number }`, 404 for unpublished or unknown articles.
- `GET /api/fediverse/articles/stats?documentIds=a,b,c` (at most 50, else 400) → `{ [documentId]: { likes, boosts, replies } }`. Only articles published in the default locale are included; other ids are left out. `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60`.
- `GET /api/fediverse/articles/ranking?page=1&pageSize=6&locale=es&category=ia&tag=vue&search=rag` → `{ data: [{ documentId, likes, boosts, replies }], meta: { pagination: { page, pageSize, pageCount, total } } }`. Articles published in `locale` (default locale if omitted), ordered by `likes + boosts + replies` desc, then `publishedAt` desc; articles with no interactions come last so paging covers the whole blog. `pageSize` defaults to 6, max 50. Optional filters narrow the list before ranking, so pages match the blog filters: `category` (category slug), `tag` (tag slug; combined with the others with AND) and `search` (title contains it, case-insensitive; `%` and `_` are plain text; ignored under 3 characters). `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60`.

`replies` counts approved comments with a `fediverseUri` (every fediverse reply has one, even when its actor handle could not be resolved) that are not removed or blocked. Blocked actors' likes, boosts and replies never count.

### Dependencies

- `@fedify/fedify` (pin exact 2.x version — the framework moves fast)
- `@fedify/koa` (Koa v2/v3 middleware)
- `@js-temporal/polyfill` (Fedify's timestamp type; explicit because Node has no global `Temporal`)

### Environment variables

| Variable                     | Default                                                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `FRONTEND_DEFAULT_LOCALE`    | `en`                                                          | Locale the frontend serves without a URL prefix (Nuxt `prefix_except_default`); articles in any other locale get `/<locale>` in their link, e.g. `https://bogdev.com.co/es/blog/{slug}`                  |

### KV store

Fedify needs a `kv` for caches and inbox idempotency. **MVP: `MemoryKvStore`** — all persistent state (followers, actor keys, interactions, comments, and the `federatedArticles` record of which articles were already sent) lives in Strapi content types or the plugin store, so a restart only loses caches. Comment ingestion dedupes by `fediverseUri` regardless, so no duplicate comments can occur across restarts. Upgrade path: `@fedify/postgres` (note: it opens a second pool — watch Postgres connection limits) or `@fedify/redis`.

---

## Federation Flows

### 1. Follow

1. Remote user searches `@bogdev@api.bogdev.com.co` → WebFinger resolves → actor profile shown.
2. Inbox receives `Follow` → create `fediverse-follower` row → auto-send signed `Accept`. A blocked actor's `Follow` is ignored with no answer (neither `Accept` nor `Reject`, so it is not told it is blocked).
3. `Undo(Follow)` or incoming `Block` → remove follower, unless the actor is blocked: a blocked row is kept, so an actor cannot lift its own block. Admin sets `blocked: true` → excluded from fan-out, their activities ignored. Deleting a blocked row in the admin panel lifts the block (the next `Follow` creates a fresh row): to keep it, leave the row and its flag. Unblocking an actor whose row was kept makes it an active follower again, even if it undid its follow meanwhile; delete the row instead to drop it.

### 2. Publish / update / delete articles

1. Plugin `bootstrap()` subscribes via `strapi.eventHub.on(...)` to `entry.publish`, `entry.unpublish` and `entry.delete` (payload `{ model, uid, entry }`). Events fire **asynchronously, after the operation's transaction commits** — handlers must not assume the DB still holds the pre-operation state. In Strapi 5 an edit only reaches the published version when the editor publishes again, so `entry.publish` is also the signal for edits.
2. `entry.publish` → build `Article` object → signed `Create(Article)` addressed **publicly** (`to: https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public`, `cc:` the followers collection) and delivered to every accepted follower's inbox. Public addressing — not just `cc` to followers — is what makes the post eligible for a remote instance's local/federated timeline and public directories; addressing it only to followers would silently cap reach at people who already follow the blog, which undermines the "consumed on other networks" goal (see [Discoverability on Other Networks](#discoverability-on-other-networks)).
3. The same `Create(Article)` activities are also served from a public **outbox dispatcher** (`/fediverse/user/devbog/outbox`, paginated), so a remote server that discovers the actor — e.g. someone views the profile before deciding to follow — can backfill recent posts. Several Mastodon-derived UIs fetch the outbox on first contact with an unfollowed account.
4. Mastodon renders `Article` as a link card (title, excerpt, cover image from `resources.bogdev.com.co`, link to frontend).
5. Re-publishing an article that was already sent → `Update(Article)` (tracked in the plugin store key `federatedArticles`, so no duplicate `Create`); unpublish or delete → `Delete(Article)` with a `Tombstone`, but only if no published default-locale version remains. Failures are logged and never break the editor's publish flow; with no followers nothing is sent and the log says so.
6. Article AP id is stable: `/fediverse/articles/{documentId}`.
7. **i18n:** only the default locale federates in the MVP.

### 3. Reply → comment

1. Inbox receives `Create(Note)` with `inReplyTo` pointing at:
   - our article AP id (`/fediverse/articles/{documentId}`) → top-level comment, or
   - the frontend article URL pattern (some clients use `url`), or
   - another note's URI matching a stored comment's `fediverseUri` → `threadOf` = that comment (one hop). Anything that doesn't resolve to one of our published articles is ignored: it is not our conversation.
2. Create `plugin::comments.comment` via `strapi.documents()`:

| Comment field          | Source                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content`              | Remote Note content, sanitized to plain text (strip HTML)                                                                     |
| `authorName`           | Actor `name` or `preferredUsername@host`                                                                                      |
| `authorAvatar`         | Actor `icon.url`                                                                                                              |
| `authorId`             | Remote actor URI (stable identity). `authorEmail` is never set: the plugin exposes it publicly                                |
| `threadOf`             | Resolved parent (see above), else `null`                                                                                      |
| `approvalStatus`       | `PENDING` — set explicitly; the plugin's public API would show it, so a global middleware hides it until a moderator approves |
| `locale`               | The default (federated) locale; the frontend reads comments per locale (`?locale=`), and only that version federates          |
| `fediverseUri`         | Note object id (dedupe key)                                                                                                   |
| `fediverseActorHandle` | `@user@host`, or `null` when it could not be resolved                                                                         |

3. Dedupe: skip if a comment with the same `fediverseUri` exists.
4. `Update(Note)` → edit the content **and send the comment back to `PENDING`** (an approved comment must not be swappable for spam); `Delete(Note)` → set `removed`. Both are only honoured from the original author.
5. Admin approves/rejects in the existing comments moderation view — no new admin UI needed.

### 4. Likes & boosts

1. Inbox receives `Like(Article)` → upsert `fediverse-interaction` (type `like`).
2. `Announce(Article)` → upsert type `boost`.
3. `Undo(Like)` / `Undo(Announce)` → remove the row.
4. Stats endpoint aggregates counts for the frontend.

## Discoverability on Other Networks

The MVP's technical mechanism is accepting `Follow`s and fanning out to followers, but the actual goal — blog content **consumed on other social networks**, not only by people who already follow the blog — needs a bit more than that:

- **Public addressing** (Federation Flows §2) is required for posts to land in a remote instance's local/federated timeline and directories, not just in individual followers' home feeds. This is a correctness requirement for Phase 2, not a nice-to-have — without it, federation "works" (followers see posts) but the blog is effectively invisible to everyone else on that instance.
- **Outbox dispatcher** (`/fediverse/user/devbog/outbox`) lets remote servers and apps enumerate recent posts without requiring a follow first. The architecture diagram already lists this endpoint; the phase checklists below now call it out explicitly so it doesn't get skipped as "just an implementation detail" of the actor dispatcher.
- **`discoverable` actor flag** (`toot:discoverable: true`, from Mastodon's `toot` vocabulary extension namespace): opts the actor into Mastodon's public directory and "suggested accounts." Set on the `Person` object (done in Phase 1).
- **Cross-server verification**: ActivityPub implementations diverge in how they parse `Article` and `Person` objects. Mastodon is the reference target, but Pleroma/Akkoma, Misskey, Friendica, and GoToSocial are all realistic destinations for this blog's followers, and Meta's Threads has historically shipped partial/limited outbound federation. Still open: verify against at least one non-Mastodon server (Phase 5), not only Mastodon accounts / activitypub.academy.
- **Fediverse relays** (submitting the actor's public posts to a relay so instances with no existing followers of this domain still see them) are a plausible reach multiplier beyond direct follows, but out of scope for the MVP — tracked under Future Work.

## Moderation & Security

- **Signature verification:** Fedify verifies HTTP signatures before listeners run — unsigned/forged activities never reach ingestion code. That only covers the _outer_ activity's actor, so listeners also check that an embedded activity (`Undo(Follow)`) or object (`Note.attributedTo`) belongs to the verified sender, and interaction withdrawals key on the verified sender.
- **Content sanitization:** remote Note content is HTML from untrusted servers — strip to plain text before storing.
- **Moderation:** all fediverse replies enter `PENDING` and are approved in the existing comments moderation view; remote actors can be `blocked` (their replies are ignored). The `approvalScores`/`moderation`/`nested` options in `config/plugins.ts` are **not** options of `strapi-plugin-comments` 3.x (the only approval option is `approvalFlow: [uids]`) and have no effect; `PENDING` is set explicitly by the reply-ingest code. Edited replies go back to `PENDING` so an approved comment can't be swapped for spam.
- **Pending replies are hidden by a global middleware.** The plugin's public endpoints return _every_ comment unless the caller filters by `approvalStatus`, and the frontend doesn't. `src/middlewares/hide-unapproved-comments.ts` (registered in `config/middlewares.ts`) prunes `PENDING`/`REJECTED` comments and their subtrees from `GET /api/comments/*`. It is app-level rather than part of the fediverse plugin so it keeps protecting readers even if the plugin is later disabled.
- **Public API surface unchanged:** fediverse endpoints are handled by Fedify's middleware outside Strapi's auth/permissions; the only new public REST route is the stats endpoint (`auth: false`). No seed/permission changes required.
- **SSRF:** Fedify fetches remote objects (standard fediverse behavior); keep Fedify updated to benefit from its fetch hardening.

## Implementation Phases

Tracked as GitHub issues under the `fediverse-federation` milestone. Check off as completed.

### Phase 0 — Spike: mount Fedify in Strapi `[x]` (#3)

- [x] Local plugin skeleton + `@fedify/fedify`@2.3.6 / `@fedify/koa`@2.3.6 (pinned exact) installed and mounted via `strapi.server.use()` in `register()`
- [x] Verify `/.well-known/webfinger` responds on `npm run dev` (200 JRD, correct subject + self link)
- [x] Verify inbox `POST` is intercepted: unsigned and forged-signature deliveries are rejected with `401 Failed to verify the request signature.` **before any listener runs** (full signed delivery from a real server is verified manually in Phase 1 via a follow from activitypub.academy)
- [x] Resolve middleware-ordering risk (#1) — primary strategy confirmed, no fallback needed
- [x] Confirm publish lifecycle events (risk #3) — via `strapi.eventHub`, see below

**Phase 0 findings (binding for later phases):**

- **Plugin loading (Strapi 5):** local plugins are loaded through `loadConfigFile`, which only reads `.js`/`.json` — the plugin entry must be compiled JS. The root `tsconfig.json` excludes `src/plugins/**`, so the plugin ships its own esbuild bundle (`npm run build:fediverse`, wired into `predev`/`prebuild`/`pretest`). The plugin `package.json` must have **no `main` field** (it breaks the loader's `require.resolve` path) — only `exports: { "./strapi-server": "./dist/strapi-server.js", "./package.json": "./package.json" }` plus the `strapi.kind`/`strapi.name` marker.
- **Middleware order:** `strapi.server.use()` in plugin `register()` runs before `initMiddlewares()` (hence before `strapi::body`, whose parsed body would starve Fedify's raw-body signature verification) and before the router (mounted at `listen()`). Mounting in `bootstrap()` would be too late.
- **Publish events:** Strapi 5 emits `entry.publish`/`entry.unpublish`/`entry.update`/`entry.delete` on `strapi.eventHub` (payload `{ model, uid, entry }`, sanitized full entry), **asynchronously after the operation's transaction commits**. `strapi.db.lifecycles` only sees the underlying row CRUD (`afterCreate` for publish, `afterDelete` for unpublish) and cannot distinguish publish state. Phase 2 fan-out subscribes to `eventHub`.
- **Fedify 2.x API notes:** vocabulary types import from the `@fedify/fedify/vocab` subpath; `setKeyPairsDispatcher` takes a single `(contextData, identifier)` signature; `Person.assertionMethods` must be `keyPair.multikey` (a `Multikey`), not `cryptographicKey`.
- **Jest:** `@fedify/fedify` requires `structured-field-values`, an ESM-only `.js` package. Node ≥22 `require()`s it fine (dev/prod), but Jest cannot — `jest.config.js` now uses an esbuild transformer (`tests/helpers/esbuild-transformer.js`) with `transformIgnorePatterns` allowlisting that package.
- **Spike scope:** keypairs are in-memory (regenerated per boot — fine for the spike); Phase 1 persists them in the plugin store. `tests/fediverse.test.ts` covers webfinger, actor document, content negotiation, unknown actor, unsigned inbox rejection, `/_health` isolation, and publish/unpublish event delivery.

### Phase 1 — Blog actor, keypairs, followers `[x]` (#4)

- [x] Actor dispatcher (profile from `global`), keypair generation + plugin-store persistence
- [x] `fediverse-follower` content type; `Follow` → record + signed `Accept`; `Undo(Follow)`/`Block` → remove; `blocked` flag
- [x] Followers collection + NodeInfo
- [x] Actor opts into Mastodon's directory (`toot:discoverable: true`) — see [Discoverability on Other Networks](#discoverability-on-other-networks)
- [x] Verify: search `@devbog@api.bogdev.com.co` from a Mastodon account and follow successfully

**Phase 1 findings (verified 2026-09-23 against a live Mastodon account on `staging-api.bogdev.com.co`):** the actor dispatcher (now `discoverable: true`), RSA keypair generation + JWK persistence in the plugin store, the `fediverse-follower` content type, the followers dispatcher/counter, NodeInfo, and the `Follow`/`Undo`/`Block` inbox listeners (with signed `Accept`) live in `federation.ts` and `services/{keys,actor-profile,followers}.ts`. `tests/fediverse-phase1.test.ts` covers them end-to-end, including a fully HTTP-signed `Follow` → `Accept` round trip against a fake remote actor (`tests/helpers/remote-actor.ts`).

**Actor profile (2026-09-26):** with no `global` document in production, the actor fell back to `about.title` and showed up on Mastodon as "Acerca de este blog". `about.title` is no longer a fallback (the About page heading isn't a name). The profile now reads `global.siteName`, `global.siteDescription`, `global.favicon` (avatar) and `global.fediverseHeader` (the header, 1500×500), populating the media explicitly: the document service doesn't populate media by default, so `favicon` was never reaching the actor. Mastodon caches remote profiles, so creating or saving `global` sends an `Update(Person)` to followers (`publisher.ts`, on `entry.create`/`entry.update`, since `global` has no draft & publish). The profile fields carry `rel="me"`: Mastodon only shows the green checkmark if the linked page links back to the actor with `rel="me"`.

- **Behind Traefik, Koa must trust the proxy.** Strapi 5 reads `server.proxy.koa`; the old `proxy: true` (Strapi 4 syntax) left `ctx.protocol` as `http`, and `@fedify/koa` builds request URLs from it, so every ActivityPub id came out as `http://`. `config/server.ts` now sets `proxy: { koa: true }` (regression test included). Any new federated URL must be checked over HTTPS on staging, not only locally.
- **Staging** is the live test bed: `develop` → `:staging` image / Dokploy app on `staging-api.bogdev.com.co` (see `docs/CI_CD.md`). It needs `URL`, `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED=true` and `DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite`; the app builds via Nixpacks (`npm start`), so `public/uploads` is created by the `prestart` script.

### Phase 2 — Article federation `[x]` (#5)

- [x] Article object dispatcher (`/fediverse/articles/:documentId`, stable ids, frontend `url`, cover image)
- [x] Outbox dispatcher (`/fediverse/user/devbog/outbox`, paginated), backed by the published articles, so remote servers can backfill posts without a prior follow
- [x] `entry.publish` → `Create(Article)` addressed **publicly** (`to: as:Public`, `cc:` followers) and fanned out to all accepted followers' inboxes; `Update(Article)` on re-publish; `Delete(Article)` on unpublish/delete
- [x] Verify: a published article appears in a follower's timeline (verified live on `mastodon.social`, 2026-09-23)
- [x] Verify: editing and re-publishing propagates as an `Update`, and unpublishing removes it from the remote timeline
- [x] Verify: the article is visible on the actor's profile/outbox from an account that does not follow it

**Phase 2 findings:**

- **Code layout:** `services/articles.ts` (loading published default-locale articles, building `Article`/`Create`/`Update`/`Delete`, tracking which articles were federated) and `services/publisher.ts` (subscribes to `entry.publish` / `entry.unpublish` / `entry.delete` and sends to `'followers'`). The `Federation` instance is now one per Strapi instance (`getFederation(strapi)`), shared by the HTTP middleware and the publisher. `tests/fediverse-phase2.test.ts` covers the dispatcher, outbox, and the fan-out against a fake remote inbox.
- **Editing = publishing again.** In Strapi 5 an edit only reaches the published version when the editor publishes it, which fires `entry.publish` again. The plugin store key `federatedArticles` records which documents already had a `Create` sent, so the second publish becomes `Update(Article)` instead of a duplicate `Create`. Articles published while the plugin was disabled are never retro-federated (no event, no record).
- **Delete is guarded.** Unpublish and delete both send `Delete(Article)` (with a `Tombstone`), but only if the article was federated _and_ no published default-locale version remains, so deleting a draft revision doesn't retract a live article.
- **Body shape.** `content` is self-contained HTML (bold title, escaped excerpt, link to the frontend) so it reads well on servers that ignore `name`/`image`, and the link lets Mastodon build a preview card. `summary` is intentionally **not** set — Mastodon renders it as a content warning. `image` is used instead of an attachment so Mastodon keeps the link card rather than showing a bare media attachment. It is the article's `cover` first, falling back to `seo.metaImage`; media whose mime type isn't `image/*` is skipped (both fields also accept videos and files). When the cover has a `coverCredit`, the body ends with its attribution line («Foto: autor · fuente · CC BY-SA 4.0 · recortada», with links), because licenses such as CC BY require it wherever the image is shared; `image.name` stays the alt text. **The article was seen in a Mastodon timeline on staging;** how the card/body actually renders on Mastodon and on other servers (Pleroma, Misskey) is still worth a visual check.
- **Frontend URLs are locale-aware.** The frontend serves `en` unprefixed and `es` under `/es` (`prefix_except_default`), and the article page loads the post for the _current_ locale. The federated link therefore gets `/<locale>` whenever the article's locale differs from `FRONTEND_DEFAULT_LOCALE`; if Strapi's default locale is `es`, links become `https://bogdev.com.co/es/blog/{slug}`.
- **Delivery failures are logged.** Fedify reports outbox/inbox failures through LogTape, which isn't configured, so a rejected delivery (for example Mastodon answering 401/422) used to leave no trace. `onOutboxError` and the inbox `onError` now write `[fediverse] ...` entries to Strapi's log — look there first when a post doesn't reach a timeline.
- **Publish logs say who received it.** Each fan-out logs `[fediverse] Create(Article) for <id> (<slug>): delivered to N followers` or `no followers yet, nothing delivered`; with no followers nothing is sent at all. "The article never reached my timeline" is usually a missing follow — check that line first.
- **Staging state must persist.** Followers, the actor key pair and federated-article records live in the SQLite database. If `/app/.tmp` isn't a persistent volume, every deploy regenerates the actor key and drops all followers (visible as `hasAdmin: false` on `/admin/init` and a `generated and persisted a new actor key pair` log line), and remote servers keep a follow and a cached key that no longer match.
- **Background context origin.** Work not tied to a request (the publisher) builds ids from Strapi's public `URL` (`strapi.config.get('server.url')`), so `URL` must be correct in every deployed environment or activity ids will not match the ones served over HTTP.
- **`slug` is not autogenerated by the document service** (only by the admin UI). Articles without a slug or title are skipped with a `[fediverse] not federating article ...` warning, because there would be no frontend URL to link to. Tests must pass `slug` explicitly.
- **Test harness fix:** `tests/strapi.ts` passed an absolute `DATABASE_FILENAME`, but `config/database.ts` joins it to the project root, so the real SQLite file landed in a stray `home/...` directory the harness never cleaned. Stale rows leaked between runs and eventually pushed articles off the first API page. The path is now relative to the project root.

### Phase 3 — Fediverse replies → moderated comments `[x]` (#6)

- [x] Comment schema extension (`fediverseUri`, `fediverseActorHandle`) via `src/extensions/comments/strapi-server.ts`
- [x] `services/replies.ts`: `Create(Note)` → `PENDING` comment; dedupe by `fediverseUri`; `threadOf` resolution; plain-text sanitization; replies addressing the article by its `id` or its frontend `url`; blocked actors, unpublished articles, unrelated notes and forged authors ignored
- [x] `Update(Note)` → edit (back to `PENDING`); `Delete(Note)` → `removed`
- [x] Global middleware hiding `PENDING`/`REJECTED` comments from the public comments API
- [x] Verify live (2026-09-23, staging): reply from Mastodon → `PENDING` comment in the admin → approve → visible through the comments REST API; reply to that reply nests correctly; deleting the Mastodon reply marks it removed

**Phase 3 findings:**

- **The comments plugin does not hide pending comments.** Its public `GET /api/comments/:relation` (hierarchy) and `/flat` only filter by what the caller passes, and the frontend passes nothing. Storing replies as `PENDING` alone would have published remote spam instantly. The `hide-unapproved-comments` middleware fixes this in the backend; a mutation check (removing it) makes the visibility test fail.
- **Approval config in `config/plugins.ts` is inert.** See Moderation & Security above. Note that comments left through the site's own form are therefore approved immediately today; enabling the plugin's real `approvalFlow: ['api::article.article']` would put those in `PENDING` too (a product decision, not made here).
- **Comment `related` is `api::article.article:<documentId>`** (not the numeric id), and `threadOf` is set through the document service by the parent's `documentId`.
- **Author mapping:** `authorId` = remote actor URI (stable identity), `authorName` = actor name or `preferredUsername`, `authorAvatar` = actor icon, `fediverseActorHandle` = `@user@host`. `authorEmail` is deliberately never set: the plugin exposes it publicly.
- **Threading is one hop.** A reply to a stored fediverse reply attaches to it via `threadOf`; a reply to something we don't know is ignored (not our conversation), not attached as top-level.
- **Sanitization order:** tags are stripped first (keeping `<br>`/paragraph breaks), entities decoded after, so an encoded `&lt;script&gt;` ends up as literal text, never markup. The frontend renders comments as text (no `v-html`). Mastodon's leading `@bogdev` mention (or the former `@devbog`) is stripped; content is capped at 5000 characters.
- **Authorship is checked.** A `Note` whose `attributedTo` differs from the signature-verified activity actor is dropped, and edits/deletes are only honoured from the original author.

### Phase 4 — Likes & boosts `[x]` (#7)

- [x] `plugin::fediverse.interaction` content type; `Like`/`Announce` + `Undo` handlers
- [x] `GET /api/fediverse/articles/:documentId/stats` public route (`auth: false`, aggregates only)
- [x] Hardening found on the way: `Undo` now requires the embedded activity's actor to match the signature-verified sender
- [x] Verify live (2026-09-23, staging): a like and a boost from Mastodon move the counts; undoing them decrements

**Phase 4 findings:**

- **The article is referenced by `articleDocumentId` (a string), not by a relation** as the original plan said. Articles are draft-and-publish and localized, so a relation points at one specific row and can be orphaned every time the article is re-published; the documentId is stable. Interactions of a deleted article are left behind (never counted: the stats route 404s for unknown articles).
- **`unique: true` in a Strapi schema is not a database constraint.** It is only enforced by the Document Service's validation; the table gets no unique index, so `db.query` can insert duplicates. `interactions.ts` therefore builds a single `interactionKey` (`type|actor|article`) and settles concurrent deliveries _after_ the insert — every writer deletes all rows for the key except the oldest — which converges to one row even across processes and on Postgres, where a lower id can commit after a higher one (a test fires five concurrent inserts). The same caveat applies to `fediverseUri` on comments and `actorId` on followers, which are checked before inserting but are not race-proof; simultaneous duplicate deliveries of the same activity are unlikely, so this was left as is.
- **Blocked actors don't count, retroactively.** `countInteractions` excludes blocked actors' rows, so blocking someone also removes their earlier likes from the totals.
- **`Undo` and embedded activities.** Only the outer activity's actor is covered by the HTTP signature. Fedify already refuses to trust an embedded object from a _different origin_ (it tries to re-fetch it), but for two accounts on the _same_ origin the embedded actor was trusted, so the `Undo(Follow)` handler could be made to remove another account's follow. It now requires `undone.actor === undo.actor` (a test fails without it). `Undo(Like/Announce)` removes by the verified sender, so it can only ever retract the sender's own interaction.
- **Stats endpoint:** returns `{ likes, boosts }` only — never who interacted — and 404s for unpublished or unknown articles. It is a plugin content-API route (`routes/index.ts` + `controllers/stats.ts`) so it is served at `/api/fediverse/articles/:documentId/stats`, outside the Fedify middleware paths.

### Batch counts and ranking `[x]` (#16)

- [x] `GET /api/fediverse/articles/stats` (batch) and `GET /api/fediverse/articles/ranking` for the frontend's Bitácora view and "most discussed in the fediverse" sort
- [x] Tests with interactions, replies in every moderation state, a blocked actor, a draft, a tie and a second locale (`tests/fediverse-stats.test.ts`)

**Findings:**

- **One aggregate query, not a loop.** `services/stats.ts` builds two grouped subqueries — interactions by `articleDocumentId`, fediverse replies by `related` — and left-joins them onto the published article rows of the locale, ordering and paging in SQL. The batch route reuses the same subqueries filtered by id. Table and column names come from `strapi.db.metadata`, not hardcoded.
- **Counts are per document, not per locale.** Interactions reference the documentId and replies arrive through the default-locale article, so an article shows the same counts in every locale; `locale` only selects which published articles are listed.
- **Postgres and GROUP BY.** The reply subquery selects `SUBSTR(related, n)` but groups by `related` itself: two parameterized `SUBSTR()` calls in `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` are different expressions to Postgres. `COUNT`/`SUM` come back as strings on Postgres and are converted to numbers.

### Phase 5 — Tests, lint, docs, deployment `[~]` (#8)

- [x] Integration and unit coverage of everything the issue lists — WebFinger (`fediverse.test.ts`), actor, keys and follower add/remove with signed `Follow`/`Undo`/`Block` (`fediverse-phase1`), article dispatcher/outbox/fan-out (`phase2`), signed `Create(Note)` → `PENDING` comment with field mapping, dedupe, nesting and sanitizer/URL/prune unit tests (`phase3`), likes/boosts and the public stats route (`phase4`), and the switched-off plugin (`fediverse-disabled`)
- [x] `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `npm run build` green; the whole suite also passes on **PostgreSQL** and under **Node 20.20** (the production image's runtime)
- [x] Update this document's status markers; add `.claude/skills/strapi-fediverse/SKILL.md`
- [x] Deployment notes: fediverse env vars, requirements and a production rollout/rollback checklist in `docs/CI_CD.md`
- [ ] Cross-server verification against at least one non-Mastodon implementation (Pleroma/Akkoma, Misskey, or GoToSocial) — see [Discoverability on Other Networks](#discoverability-on-other-networks). Waiting on account approval on a non-Mastodon server (as of 2026-09-24)
- [x] Enable in production (`develop` → `main` via #10 and #11, `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED=true` on the production Dokploy app). Checked 2026-09-24: `/_health` 204; WebFinger, the actor and NodeInfo answer 200 on `api.bogdev.com.co`

**Phase 5 findings:**

- **PostgreSQL parity.** Production is PostgreSQL but the suites only ran on SQLite. `tests/strapi.ts` now runs against Postgres when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set (one database per Jest worker, recreated at start), and all suites pass there. It also confirmed that Strapi creates no unique indexes on Postgres either.
- **Runtime parity.** The production `Dockerfile` uses `node:20-alpine`, whereas staging (Nixpacks) runs Node 22. Fedify needs an ESM-only package that `require()` only loads on Node ≥ 20.19 / ≥ 22.12, so `engines` now says `>=20.19.0`. The complete suite was run under Node 20.20.2 with Postgres. The Docker image (Alpine, `Dockerfile` layout) was first built end to end by the production deploy, and runs there.
- **Switched-off plugin is tested.** With `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED=false` no route, content type or hook exists, article publishing is unaffected, and the comments-visibility middleware still hides pending comments.
- **Wire-format check against staging** with `npx @fedify/cli` (`webfinger`, `nodeinfo`, `lookup`): the actor (with `inbox`, `outbox`, `followers`, keys, `discoverable`) and a federated article parse cleanly. The CLI uses the same library as the plugin, so this validates the format, not other servers' behaviour, and does not replace the cross-server item above.
- **CI scope.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs only for pull requests to and pushes on `main`; `develop` pushes deploy to staging without running it. The `develop` → `main` pull request is where CI gates this work, and it does not run the Postgres variant of the suite.
- **Production incident: the Fedify middleware stalled large request bodies (found the day it was enabled).** `@fedify/koa` turns the Node request stream of every non-GET request into a web stream _before_ deciding whether the route is its own. That stream pauses the shared Node stream once its queue fills (bodies of roughly 16 KB on Node 20, 64 KB on Node 24), and because the middleware runs ahead of `strapi::body` nobody drains it, so any large POST/PUT elsewhere in the app hung until the client aborted — publishing a long article in the admin was the first to show it (`request aborted` in `raw-body`, a 2-minute request). Small bodies were fine, which is why staging, the tests and every earlier check missed it. `mountFediverseMiddleware` now only runs Fedify for `/fediverse/*`, `/.well-known/*` and `/nodeinfo/*`; `tests/fediverse.test.ts` posts a 512 KB body to a non-federation route (the test times out without the fix). Lesson: a global middleware that touches the request stream needs a large-body test on an unrelated route.
- **Request guard hook for rate limiting (#100).** The Fedify middleware is mounted in the plugin's `register()` and runs ahead of every root middleware, so no root middleware ever sees federation requests. `mountFediverseMiddleware` therefore calls an optional guard (`types/request-guard.ts`: `(ctx, kind: 'inbox' | 'read') => Promise<boolean>`, `true` = response already written, e.g. 429) on federation paths before Fedify touches the request stream, so a rejected request is answered with its body unread. `kind` is `inbox` for a POST whose path matches `INBOX_PATH` or `SHARED_INBOX_PATH` (a trailing slash counts too), `read` otherwise. The guard is passed through config (`plugin::fediverse.requestGuard`) rather than imported because the plugin never imports from root `src/`, and it is read on every request because the root `register()` (which sets it) runs after the plugin's, when the middleware is already mounted. Missing or non-function guard: federation works as before. A guard that throws or rejects fails open, with a warning logged at most once a minute and no request data.
- **NodeInfo** reports `localComments: 0` unconditionally; making it a real count is a possible refinement.
- **Handle change `@devbog` → `@bogdev` (2026-09-26) without losing followers.** The handle's `@user` (`preferredUsername`, `FEDIVERSE_ACTOR_USERNAME`) is now separate from the actor identifier (`FEDIVERSE_ACTOR_IDENTIFIER`, the URI path), and the actor dispatcher sets Fedify's `mapHandle`, so WebFinger resolves `acct:bogdev@…` — and the former `acct:devbog@…` — to the unchanged `/fediverse/user/devbog`. Remote servers key accounts by URI, so follows and already-federated posts keep working; Mastodon shows the new handle once it refetches the actor (it re-verifies `preferredUsername` through WebFinger). Renaming the identifier instead would have orphaned every follow.

## Future Work (Out of Scope for MVP)

- Locale-specific federation objects (`inLanguage` fan-out, per-locale handles)
- Blog-actor outbound replies into remote threads (admin replies federate back to Mastodon)
- `fediverse:creator` author attribution
- Admin UI panel in Strapi admin
- Postgres/Redis KV upgrade
- WebFinger on the frontend domain (`@bogdev@bogdev.com.co`) via Dokploy proxy
- Fediverse relay submission for reach beyond direct followers

## Implementation notes

Non-obvious findings moved from `CLAUDE.md` (#113), unchanged except for the opening sentence. The plugin lives in `src/plugins/fediverse/` and is a local Strapi plugin (not a workspace package) implementing ActivityPub federation with `@fedify/fedify` + `@fedify/koa`. It is gated by `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED` (default `false`) in `config/plugins.ts`. Read this document before touching it, or `src/extensions/comments/` (which adds `fediverseUri`/`fediverseActorHandle` fields to the comments schema for reply ingestion/dedupe).

- Fedify's middleware is mounted in plugin `register()` (not `bootstrap()`), via `strapi.server.use()` directly — this must run before Strapi's `initMiddlewares()` mounts `strapi::body`, since HTTP signature verification needs the raw request body, and before the router mounts at `listen()` time.
- Strapi 5 does **not** emit `afterPublish`/`afterUnpublish` through `strapi.db.lifecycles`; publish/unpublish state is only observable via `strapi.eventHub` (`entry.publish` / `entry.unpublish`), fired asynchronously after the transaction commits.
- All federation state that must survive a restart (followers, actor keys, interactions) is stored in Strapi content types, not Fedify's `MemoryKvStore` (which only backs transient caches/idempotency).
- Strapi's `unique: true` is only Document Service validation — there is no database index, so `db.query` writes can create duplicates. Race-prone inserts (see `services/interactions.ts`) dedupe after inserting.
- The Fedify Koa middleware is guarded to federation paths only (`mountFediverseMiddleware`): unguarded, it stalls any non-GET request with a body over ~16 KB on other routes, because it consumes the request stream before `strapi::body` can.
- Behind Traefik, `config/server.ts` needs `proxy: { koa: true }`; otherwise `ctx.protocol` is `http` and every ActivityPub URL is generated with the wrong scheme.
- Fediverse code paths are split across `federation.ts` (Fedify dispatchers and inbox listeners) and `services/` (`articles`, `publisher`, `replies`, `interactions`, `followers`, `keys`, `actor-profile`); `docs/FEDIVERSE.md` has the per-phase findings.
- The comments plugin findings are in [architecture/comments.md](architecture/comments.md).
