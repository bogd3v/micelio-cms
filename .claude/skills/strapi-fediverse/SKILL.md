description: Use when working on the ActivityPub/fediverse federation of the Micelio site — the src/plugins/fediverse plugin, Fedify, followers, article federation, replies as comments, likes/boosts, the stats endpoint, FEDIVERSE_* env vars, or testing federation locally and on staging.

# Strapi Fediverse Skill

The site is an ActivityPub actor (`@blog@<api domain>`) served by a local Strapi plugin built on **Fedify**. Read `docs/FEDIVERSE.md` first: it is the architecture doc and records the findings behind every non-obvious decision. This skill is the quick map.

## When to use this skill

- Changing anything under `src/plugins/fediverse/`, `src/extensions/comments/`, or `src/middlewares/hide-unapproved-comments.ts`.
- Adding an activity type, a dispatcher, or a public route for federation.
- Debugging "the post never reached Mastodon", missing followers, or wrong URLs in activities.
- Enabling or configuring federation in an environment.

Outside the plugin: `src/extensions/comments/strapi-server.ts` (adds `fediverseUri`, `fediverseActorHandle`) and `src/middlewares/hide-unapproved-comments.ts`.

The plugin is its own TypeScript project bundled by esbuild (`npm run build:fediverse`, run by the `pre*` hooks). After editing plugin code, rebuild before using `npx jest` directly.

## Endpoints

Served by Fedify, outside Strapi auth: `/.well-known/webfinger`, `/nodeinfo/2.1`, `/fediverse/user/:id` (actor), `/fediverse/user/:id/{inbox,outbox,followers}`, `/fediverse/inbox`, `/fediverse/articles/:documentId`. Public Strapi routes (aggregates only, cached 60 s where noted in `docs/FEDIVERSE.md`): `GET /api/fediverse/articles/:documentId/stats` → `{ likes, boosts }` (404 for unpublished); `GET /api/fediverse/articles/stats?documentIds=a,b,c` → `{ [documentId]: { likes, boosts, replies } }` (max 50); `GET /api/fediverse/articles/ranking?page&pageSize&locale&category&tag&search` → most discussed first.

## How it behaves

- **Follow:** `Follow` → follower row + signed `Accept`. A blocked actor's `Follow` gets no answer. `actorId` has no database index, so followers settle duplicate rows like interactions do; treat an actor as blocked if any of its rows is. `Undo(Follow)`/`Block` remove it unless the actor is blocked (the row is kept, so only an admin lifts a block). A blocked actor's activities are ignored and their interactions stop counting.
- **Articles:** the `federated-article` row (`status`, `lastActivityAt`, `lastActivityType`, `attempts`, `lastError`) is written before each send; an article is federated while its row is not `deleted`. Publishing queues `Create(Article)` (public `to`, followers in `cc`); publishing an already-sent article again is an `Update`; unpublish/delete is a `Delete`. Only the default locale, only published, and only articles with a `slug`. Each fan-out logs how many followers it was queued for (`no followers yet` means nothing was queued).
- **Delivery:** `sendActivity` only enqueues; Fedify delivers in the background and retries with its default backoff. A failure raises `attempts` and sets `lastError`; the row turns `failed` only when Fedify gives up (retries exhausted, or a `404`/`410`). A `404`/`410` also sets `follower.unreachableSince`, and fan-outs skip that follower until it sends any activity (`heardFrom`). Fedify has no success callback: say "queued", never "delivered".
- **Moderator replies:** an admin's reply (`isAdminComment`) to a fediverse comment goes out as a signed `Create(Note)` (to the remote author, cc public and followers); edit → `Update`, removed, blocked, rejected or pending → `Delete` with a `Tombstone`; `GET /fediverse/notes/<id>` is a 404 once it is not shown. Readers' and guests' comments never federate.
- **Replies:** a `Create(Note)` replying to an article (by ActivityPub id or frontend URL) or to a stored reply becomes a `PENDING` comment. Content is stripped to plain text. Edits go back to `PENDING`; deletes set `removed`. Anything else is ignored.
- **Moderation:** approve/reject in the admin comments moderation view. The global middleware hides `PENDING`/`REJECTED` comments from `GET /api/comments/*`; never remove it.
- **Profile:** saving the `global` single type sends `Update(Person)` so followers' servers refresh the cached name, bio, avatar and header.
- **Likes/boosts:** `Like`/`Announce` of a published article are recorded once per (type, actor, article); `Undo` removes only the sender's own.

## Pitfalls that cost time before

- Strapi's `unique: true` creates **no database index**; `db.query` can insert duplicates. Dedupe after insert if a race matters (see `services/interactions.ts`).
- `strapi-plugin-comments` config keys other than `enabledCollections` are inert, and its public API shows pending comments unless the middleware hides them. Extend its schema through `strapi-server.ts`, never with an extension `schema.json` (shallow merge replaces all attributes).
- Behind a TLS-terminating proxy `config/server.ts` needs `proxy: { koa: true }`, or every generated URL is `http://`.
- Only the outer activity's actor is signature-verified: check embedded actors/authors against it (`Undo`, `Note.attributedTo`).
- The document service does not autogenerate `slug` (only the admin UI does); articles without one are skipped with a warning.
- The queued message carries the actor's private key as a plain JWK; `ObservedMessageQueue` encrypts it. Never hand Fedify a queue without that wrapper. `PostgresMessageQueue` deletes a message before handling it and handles one at a time.
- A refused delivery is POSTed twice per attempt (Fedify double-knocks), and the remote's answer is untrusted text: never log or store `SendActivityError.message`.
- Fedify logs through LogTape; `utils/fedify-logging.ts` forwards its `warning`+ records to `strapi.log` as `[fediverse] <category>: …` (once a minute per template, no record properties), and `onOutboxError`/inbox `onError` add their own `[fediverse]` lines. An inbox `401` also writes `security: fediverse.inbox.signature-refused` (`reason` `digest-algorithm` for a `Digest` with no SHA-256 or SHA-512 entry and `content-digest-not-covered` for an RFC 9421 signature that skips `content-digest`, both refused before Fedify; `invalid-signature` otherwise). Do not configure LogTape anywhere else; see `docs/FEDIVERSE.md` (Fedify's LogTape records).
- The Fedify Koa middleware must only run for federation paths (`/fediverse/*`, `/.well-known/*`, `/nodeinfo/*`): it consumes the request stream of every non-GET request it sees, which hangs any large POST/PUT elsewhere (long articles in the admin). Keep the path guard in `mountFediverseMiddleware`.
- A staging database that is wiped on deploy drops followers and regenerates the actor key. `/app/.tmp` must be a persistent volume.
- The actor private key is stored encrypted with `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`utils/key-encryption.ts`). A decryption failure throws and must never fall through to generating a new pair (a new identity for every follower). Fedify turns a throwing key pairs dispatcher into "no keys", so `buildActor` refuses to serve a keyless actor; `mountFediverseMiddleware` answers those key errors itself with a generic `500` (`Internal Server Error`), because one that escapes to Koa is printed with its stack on every request, and the cause is logged at most once a minute. See `docs/FEDIVERSE.md` (Actor key at rest).

## Testing

```bash
npm test                     # all suites, SQLite, one database file per Jest worker
npx jest tests/fediverse-phase3.test.ts --forceExit   # one suite (run npm run build:fediverse first)
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres npm test   # PostgreSQL, as in production
```

- Suites boot a real Strapi; they set `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED` in `beforeAll`, before `setupStrapi()`, and `tests/fediverse-disabled.test.ts` covers the switched-off case.
- `tests/helpers/remote-actor.ts` starts a fake remote server (signed actor + recording inbox); `postSignedActivity()` signs a POST with Fedify's `signRequest`. `allowPrivateAddress` is on only when `NODE_ENV=test`, so 127.0.0.1 actors can be dereferenced.
- Wait for async work with `tests/helpers/wait-until.ts`; for "nothing happened" assertions use a short settle delay. Deliveries are queued, so a test never reads the fake inbox right after publishing.
- `createRemoteActor({ inboxFailures: { status, times } })` makes the first POSTs fail (two per Fedify attempt); `strapi.config.set('plugin::fediverse.outboxRetryPolicy', createExponentialBackoffPolicy({ initialDelay: { milliseconds: 20 }, maxAttempts: 2, jitter: false }))` shortens the backoff, and must be set back to `undefined` afterwards.
- PostgreSQL: the queue tests (`fediverse-queue-postgres`, `fediverse-delivery-restart`) run only with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, and `setupStrapi({ keepDatabase: true })` reboots on the same database. A whole-suite run needs a server with room for the workers (`max_connections`, `max_locks_per_transaction`), or `--maxWorkers`.
- Same-origin forgery cases matter: Fedify already refuses embedded objects from a different origin, so test forgery with ids on the sender's own origin.

## Testing against the real fediverse

- **Staging** (a public HTTPS domain, see `docs/operate/configure.md`): follow `@blog@staging.example.com` from a Mastodon account, publish an article with a slug, reply/like/boost, and read the app logs for `[fediverse]` lines. Do not redeploy between following and publishing unless `/app/.tmp` is persistent.
- **Fedify CLI** (same library as the plugin, so it checks the wire format, not other servers' behaviour): `npx @fedify/cli webfinger @blog@<domain>`, `npx @fedify/cli lookup @blog@<domain> <article-url>`, `npx @fedify/cli nodeinfo <domain>`, and `npx @fedify/cli inbox` for an ephemeral inbox behind a tunnel.
- Cross-server behaviour (Pleroma/Akkoma, Misskey, GoToSocial) still needs a manual check against a real instance.

## Do not

- Enable `FEDIVERSE_ENABLED` in an environment whose `URL` is not its real public origin.
- Add a listener that trusts an embedded actor/author without comparing it to the verified sender.
- Show pending comments or interaction actors on a public route.
- Rely on `MemoryKvStore` for anything that must survive a restart.
