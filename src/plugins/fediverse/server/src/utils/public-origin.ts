/**
 * The CMS's public origin (`URL`) when the operator has set it, for Fedify to
 * build every actor, inbox and key id from instead of the request.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Without it Fedify takes the scheme and host from the request, which with
 * `TRUST_PROXY_PROTOCOL` means `X-Forwarded-Host` and `-Proto`: a client
 * that reaches the app can then have the actor document name its own host,
 * and a cache may store it. Unset (local development, tests) keeps the
 * request-derived origin.
 *
 * @returns The origin, without path, or `undefined` when `URL` is unset or not an absolute URL.
